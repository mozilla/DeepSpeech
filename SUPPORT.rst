Contact/Getting Help
====================

There are several ways to contact us or to get help:

#. `Discourse Forums <https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mozilla-voice-stt>`_ - The `Deep Speech category on Discourse <https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mozilla-voice-stt>`_ is the first place to look. Search for keywords related to your question or problem to see if someone else has run into it already. If you can't find anything relevant there, search on our `issue tracker <https://github.com/mozilla/STT/issues>`_ to see if there is an existing issue about your problem.

#. `Matrix chat <https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#machinelearning:mozilla.org>`_ - If your question is not addressed by either the `FAQ <https://github.com/mozilla/STT/wiki#frequently-asked-questions>`_ or `Discourse Forums <https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mozilla-voice-stt>`_\ , you can contact us on the ``#machinelearning`` channel on `Mozilla Matrix <https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#machinelearning:mozilla.org>`_\ ; people there can try to answer/help

#. `Create a new issue <https://github.com/mozilla/STT/issues>`_ - Finally, if you have a bug report or a feature request that isn't already covered by an existing issue, please open an issue in our repo and fill the appropriate information on your hardware and software setup.
