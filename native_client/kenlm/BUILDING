KenLM has switched to cmake
  cmake .
  make -j 4
But they recommend building out of tree
  mkdir -p build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j 4

If you only want the query code and do not care about compression (.gz, .bz2, and .xz):
  ./compile_query_only.sh

Windows:
  The windows directory has visual studio files.  Note that you need to compile
  the kenlm project before build_binary and ngram_query projects.  

OSX:
  Missing dependencies can be remedied with brew.
  brew install cmake boost eigen
