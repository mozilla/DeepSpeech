Overview
--------

DeepSpeech is a cutting-edge open-source Speech-to-Text engine, implementing a deep learning model inspired by Baidu's seminal Deep Speech research paper (`see paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567>`_). The project leverages Google's TensorFlow framework (`learn more <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_) to streamline the development and deployment of speech recognition technology.

Features
--------

- End-to-end speech recognition based on deep learning.
- Pre-trained models for quick start.
- Comprehensive documentation for installation, usage, and training.
- Active community and contribution guidelines.
