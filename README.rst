DeepSpeech is an open-source Speech-to-Text engine built on machine learning techniques, inspired by `Baidu's Deep Speech research paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567>`_. The project utilizes Google's `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ framework, simplifying the implementation process.

Comprehensive documentation for installation, usage, and model training can be found at `deepspeech.readthedocs.io <https://deepspeech.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest>`_.

For the latest release, which includes pre-trained models and checkpoints, `check out the latest release on GitHub <https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/latest>`_.
