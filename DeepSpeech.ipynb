    "In this notebook we will reproduce the results of [Deep Speech: Scaling up end-to-end speech recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567). The core of the system is a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) trained to ingest speech spectrograms and generate English text transcriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    " Let a single utterance $x$ and label $y$ be sampled from a training set $S = \\{(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)}, y^{(2)}), . . .\\}$. Each utterance, $x^{(i)}$ is a time-series of length $T^{(i)}$ where every time-slice is a vector of audio features, $x^{(i)}_t$ where $t=1,\\ldots,T^{(i)}$. We use MFCC as our features; so $x^{(i)}_{t,p}$ denotes the $p$-th MFCC feature in the audio frame at time $t$. The goal of our BRNN is to convert an input sequence $x$ into a sequence of character probabilities for the transcription $y$, with $\\hat{y}_t =\\mathbb{P}(c_t \\mid x)$, where $c_t \\in \\{a,b,c, . . . , z, space, apostrophe, blank\\}$. (The significance of $blank$ will be explained below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our BRNN model is composed of $5$ layers of hidden units. For an input $x$, the hidden units at layer $l$ are denoted $h^{(l)}$ with the convention that $h^{(0)}$ is the input. The first three layers are not recurrent. For the first layer, at each time $t$, the output depends on the MFCC frame $x_t$ along with a context of $C$ frames on each side. (We typically use $C \\in \\{5, 7, 9\\}$ for our experiments.) The remaining non-recurrent layers operate on independent data for each time step. Thus, for each time $t$, the first $3$ layers are computed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^{(l)}_t = g(W^{(l)} h^{(l-1)}_t + b^{(l)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g(z) = \\min\\{\\max\\{0, z\\}, 20\\}$ is a clipped rectified-linear (ReLu) activation function and $W^{(l)}$, $b^{(l)}$ are the weight matrix and bias parameters for layer $l$. The fourth layer is a bidirectional recurrent layer[[1](http://www.di.ufpe.br/~fnj/RNA/bibliografia/BRNN.pdf)]. This layer includes two sets of hidden units: a set with forward recurrence, $h^{(f)}$, and a set with backward recurrence $h^{(b)}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^{(f)}_t = g(W^{(4)} h^{(3)}_t + W^{(f)}_r h^{(f)}_{t-1} + b^{(4)})$$\n",
    "$$h^{(b)}_t = g(W^{(4)} h^{(3)}_t + W^{(b)}_r h^{(b)}_{t+1} + b^{(4)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $h^{(f)}$ must be computed sequentially from $t = 1$ to $t = T^{(i)}$ for the $i$-th utterance, while\n",
    "the units $h^{(b)}$ must be computed sequentially in reverse from $t = T^{(i)}$ to $t = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth (non-recurrent) layer takes both the forward and backward units as inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^{(5)} = g(W^{(5)} h^{(4)} + b^{(5)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h^{(4)} = h^{(f)} + h^{(b)}$. The output layer are standard logits that correspond to the predicted character probabilities for each time slice $t$ and character $k$ in the alphabet:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^{(6)}_{t,k} = \\hat{y}_{t,k} = (W^{(6)} h^{(5)}_t)_k + b^{(6)}_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $b^{(6)}_k$ denotes the $k$-th bias and $(W^{(6)} h^{(5)}_t)_k$ the $k$-th element of the matrix product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have computed a prediction for $\\hat{y}_{t,k}$, we compute the CTC loss[[2]](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/preprint.pdf) $\\cal{L}(\\hat{y}, y)$ to measure the error in prediction. During training, we can evaluate the gradient $\\nabla \\cal{L}(\\hat{y}, y)$ with respect to the network outputs given the ground-truth character sequence $y$. From this point, computing the gradient with respect to all of the model parameters may be done via back-propagation through the rest of the network. We use the Adam method for training[[3](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980)].\n",
