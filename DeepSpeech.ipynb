    "In this notebook we will reproduce the results of [Deep Speech: Scaling up end-to-end speech recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567). The core of the system is a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) trained to ingest speech spectrograms and generate English text transcriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    " Let a single utterance $x$ and label $y$ be sampled from a training set $S = \\{(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)}, y^{(2)}), . . .\\}$. Each utterance, $x^{(i)}$ is a time-series of length $T^{(i)}$ where every time-slice is a vector of audio features, $x^{(i)}_t$ where $t=1,\\ldots,T^{(i)}$. We use spectrograms as our features; so $x^{(i)}_{t,p}$ denotes the power of the $p$-th frequency bin in the audio frame at time $t$. The goal of our BRNN is to convert an input sequence $x$ into a sequence of character probabilities for the transcription $y$, with $\\hat{y}_t =\\mathbb{P}(c_t \\mid x)$, where $c_t \\in \\{a,b,c, . . . , z, space, apostrophe, blank\\}$. (The significance of $blank$ will be explained below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our BRNN model is composed of $5$ layers of hidden units. For an input $x$, the hidden units at layer $l$ are denoted $h^{(l)}$ with the convention that $h^{(0)}$ is the input. The first three layers are not recurrent. For the first layer, at each time $t$, the output depends on the spectrogram frame $x_t$ along with a context of $C$ frames on each side. (We typically use $C \\in \\{5, 7, 9\\}$ for our experiments.) The remaining non-recurrent layers operate on independent data for each time step. Thus, for each time $t$, the first $3$ layers are computed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^{(l)}_t = g(W^{(l)} h^{(l-1)}_t + b^{(l)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g(z) = \\min\\{\\max\\{0, z\\}, 20\\}$ is the clipped rectified-linear (ReLu) activation function and $W^{(l)}$, $b^{(l)}$ are the weight matrix and bias parameters for layer $l$. The fourth layer is a bidirectional recurrent layer[[1](http://www.di.ufpe.br/~fnj/RNA/bibliografia/BRNN.pdf)]. This layer includes two sets of hidden units: a set with forward recurrence, $h^{(f)}$, and a set with backward recurrence $h^{(b)}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^{(f)}_t = g(W^{(4)} h^{(3)}_t + W^{(f)}_r h^{(f)}_{t-1} + b^{(4)})$$\n",
    "$$h^{(b)}_t = g(W^{(4)} h^{(3)}_t + W^{(b)}_r h^{(b)}_{t+1} + b^{(4)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $h^{(f)}$ must be computed sequentially from $t = 1$ to $t = T^{(i)}$ for the $i$-th utterance, while\n",
    "the units $h^{(b)}$ must be computed sequentially in reverse from $t = T^{(i)}$ to $t = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth (non-recurrent) layer takes both the forward and backward units as inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^{(5)} = g(W^{(5)} h^{(4)} + b^{(5)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h^{(4)} = h^{(f)} + h^{(b)}$. The output layer is a standard softmax function that yields the predicted character probabilities for each time slice $t$ and character $k$ in the alphabet:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^{(6)}_{t,k} = \\hat{y}_{t,k} \\equiv \\mathbb{P}(c_t = k \\mid x) = \\frac{\\exp{ \\left( (W^{(6)} h^{(5)}_t)_k + b^{(6)}_k \\right)}}{\\sum_j \\exp{\\left( (W^{(6)} h^{(5)}_t)_j + b^{(6)}_j \\right)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $b^{(6)}_k$ denotes the $k$-th bias and $(W^{(6)} h^{(5)}_t)_k$ the $k$-th element of the matrix product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have computed a prediction for $\\mathbb{P}(c_t = k \\mid x)$, we compute the CTC loss[[2]](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/preprint.pdf) $\\cal{L}(\\hat{y}, y)$ to measure the error in prediction. During training, we can evaluate the gradient $\\nabla \\cal{L}(\\hat{y}, y)$ with respect to the network outputs given the ground-truth character sequence $y$. From this point, computing the gradient with respect to all of the model parameters may be done via back-propagation through the rest of the network. We use the Adam method for training[[3](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980)].\n",

    "The CTC algorithm was specifically designed for temporal classification tasks; that is, for sequence labelling problems where the alignment between the inputs and the target labels is unknown. Unlike hybrid approaches combining HMM and DNN, CTC models all aspects of the sequence with a single neural network, and does not require the network to be combined with a HMM. It also does not require pre-segmented training data, or external post-processing to extract the label sequence from the network outputs.\n",

    "Generally, neural networks require separate training targets for every timeslice in the input sequence. This has two important consequences. First, it means that the training data must be pre-segmented to provide targets for every timeslice. Second, as the network only outputs local classifications, global aspects of the sequence, such as the likelihood of two labels appearing consecutively, must be modelled externally. Indeed, without some form of post-processing the final label sequence cannot reliably be inferred at all.\n",

    "CTC avoids this problem by allowing the network to make label predictions at any point in the input sequence, so long as the overall sequence of labels is correct. This removes the need for pre-segmented data, since the alignment of the labels with the input is no longer important. Moreover, CTC directly outputs the probabilities of the complete label sequences, which means that no external post-processing is required to use the network as a temporal classifier."

Indeed, when we tried using a biphone model to decode a CTC network trained for phoneme recognition, the error rate increased. However, CTC networks are typically only able to learn local relationships such as commonly occurring pairs or triples of labels.

    "In general the extension from finding the single best transcription to the $N$-best transcriptions is complex. However, in the special case of single word decoding, the $N$-best transcriptions are simply the (single word) histories of the $N$-best output tokens when the algorithm terminates."

    "Another straightforward extension to single word decoding occurs when the same word has several different label transcriptions. This happens, for example, when pronunciation variants are considered in speech recognition, or spelling variants are allowed in handwriting recognition. In that case all variants should be considered separate words until the termination of the previous algorithm (lines 34 and 34); at that point the scores of all variant transcriptions of each word should be added together in the log scale; thereafter the best or $N$-best words should be found as usual."
